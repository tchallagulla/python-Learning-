#Variables are containers for storing data values.

#Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
# creating variables: variables are used to store values.
# 1:
x= 5
y= "teju"

# 2: data type of assigned variables can be changed in a timely manner whenever required
x= 5
x= "teju"

#string variables can be declared/ assigned within "" / '' quotes 

#Rules for Python variables:
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
